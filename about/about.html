    <h3>About The Mission: Hot Chocolate</h3>

    <p>Hi! My name is Thalia Lambros, and I am a lover of a hot chocolate. 
        In this blog, I will be tasting my way around the Mission district’s hot 
        chocolate offerings in a series of three locations. As a hot chocolate 
        enthusiast living in San Francisco, I’m on a never-ending quest to discover 
        the city's most indulgent and delicious cocoa creations. Whether it’s a velvety, 
        rich classic or a unique gourmet twist, there’s nothing I’d rather do than curl
         up with a perfectly crafted cup of hot cocoa to warm both the body and soul. Being 
         from Missoula Montana, there are no gourmet cafes to pick up a mug of cinnamon 
         cocoa or traditional Oaxacan hot choco, which is why I am so excited to take 
         advantage of all the chocolatey goodness SF has to offer. San Francisco, with 
         its diverse food scene and passion for artisanal flavors, is the perfect place 
         for a hot chocolate lover like me to explore. Beginning with this short series 
         of cafes in the Mission district, I’m excited to share my journey of finding the 
         best cocoa spots this part of the city has to offer—one delicious sip at a time.
