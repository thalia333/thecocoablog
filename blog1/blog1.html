        When I went to Dandelion Chocolate on a sunny Saturday afternoon, 
        Valencia Street was bustling and thrumming with spring energy. Inside, 
        the intimate store was crowded with people sitting and enjoying their 
        drinks and browsing through the offerings of different chocolate products. 
        There were three different hot chocolate types: regular, Mission style, 
        and European sipping chocolate. I opted for the Mission, which has a special 
        flavor twist of cinnamon, cayenne, and chili. I waited in line for my hot 
        chocolate for about five minutes, but the store was well equipped for lines 
        by placing chocolate samples along the wall to taste as you waited. The Mission 
        hot chocolate ranged from $5.25-$8, depending on what size you order. 
        I suggest getting a small size because it is so rich that getting a large size
         might give you a tummy ache. My drink was ready within a couple of minutes and
          I decided to drink it outside in their cute outdoor seating. It was obvious to
           me that Dandelion Chocolate cares about their presentation because it serves 
           its drinks in innovative to-go cups that have a small, delicious cookie in a 
           carrier on the side. Bonus points for packaging and brand identity! The hot 
           chocolate was perfectly rich and creamy, without being too thick or sweet. 
           I could feel the spice tingling in my tongue and throat, enough to be satisfying 
           without traumatizing any customers. It’s obvious that they take their chocolate 
           seriously as some of the notes of th cocoa came through even though it was not 
           raw chocolate. I was very pleased with my drink and find it perfect for anyone who’s 
           looking for a gourmet hot chocolate or cocoa with a little extra flair and finesse. 
           Bonus points for cute baristas!
