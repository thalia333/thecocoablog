                Four Barrell Coffee, just down the street from Dandelion Chocolate, 
                is unassuming from the front. There’s no sign or name out front 
                alerting you of a cute coffee shop, just tables outside full of 
                people (if it’s a sunny day) and the smell of freshly ground coffee. 
                The interior is a big open space with a sleek hipster vibe, all wood 
                and warm colors, with small tables and local art on the walls. It is 
                the perfect place to work on homework or an individual project or catch
                 up with a friend. Or, to get hot chocolate. The line was not long, and 
                 I spent $6 on hot chocolate. They have one option, which is their regular 
                 hot chocolate made with chocolate ganache. It does contain dairy, so 
                 beware of that if you are lactose intolerant. They served my drink in a 
                 plain white mug, which is good for sustainability but didn’t add much in 
                 terms of brand identity. There was quite a bit of foam on the top, but once 
                 I made it past that, the texture was creamy and not too thick, and the taste 
                 was a beautiful balance of sweetness and bitterness. If you’re a dark 
                 chocolate lover like me, you will appreciate this hot chocolate! I also 
                 recommend getting a spoon to stir it with because since the chocolate is 
                 heavier than the milk, it tends to sink to the bottom of the cup.
