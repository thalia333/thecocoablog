                I was really excited to find Café de Olla because I 
                have never tried Oaxacan hot chocolate before and figured 
                it would be the perfect way to round out my series of tasters. 
                Since the cafe is on a side street off of Mission, it is 
                easy to miss if you aren’t looking for it. The space is 
                small and brightly lit, with colorful tablecloths, art, 
                and paper flags strung on the ceiling. They serve a variety 
                of drinks and food such as traditional tamales and pozole, and 
                my drink cost $7.50. After I ordered, the barista came to my 
                window table with a clay jug filled with cocoa and a wooden whisker. 
                She showed me how she was beating the hot chocolate until it was 
                frothing and well-mixed before pouring it into an adorable clay mug 
                that matched the vibe of the whole cafe. It was really cool to get to 
                see Oaxacan hot cocoa being prepared! It added more to the experience, 
                like I wasn’t just drinking something but was witnessing and participating 
                in it being made. The hot chocolate was so delicious, and tasted like 
                cocoa mixed with marshmallows. It wasn’t that thick and was made with a 
                less bitter chocolate, instead being sweeter and tasting cozy, more 
                like a regular hot chocolate.
